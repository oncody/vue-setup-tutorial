# In this tutorial, we'll show you how to include Vue in the simplest way possible--a CDN

# Open our index.html file and you will see that we include Vue from a CDN

# Globally add the 'http-server' package to NPM
yarn global add http-server

# Have 'http-server' serve our 'index.html' file
yarn start

# Open a browser to the address and port outputted from the last command
 
# If you see our message from 'main.js', then vue is working from a CDN!

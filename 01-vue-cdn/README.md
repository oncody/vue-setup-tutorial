# In this tutorial we'll show you how to include Vue in the simplest way possible--a CDN

# Open our index.html file and you will see that we include Vue from a CDN

# Globally add the 'http-server' package to NPM
yarn global add http-server

# Have http-server serve our 'index.html' file
yarn start

# Navigate in a web browser to the address and port http-server is serving our app
 
# Look for our message from index.js

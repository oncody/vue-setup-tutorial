# This simple example shows you how to include vue from a CDN

# Globally add the 'http-server' package to NPM
yarn global add http-server

# Have 'http-server' serve our 'index.html' file
yarn start

# Open a browser to the address and port outputted from the last command
 
# If you see our message from 'main.js', then vue is working from a CDN!

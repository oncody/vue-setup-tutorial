# Instead of using a CDN, let's download vue from NPM and bundle our modules with webpack.

# Install http-server globally
yarn global add http-server

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run webpack to bundle our dependencies. 
yarn build

# Start a local http server to serve our index.html file
yarn start

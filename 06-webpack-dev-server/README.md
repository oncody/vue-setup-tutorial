# In this tutorial you'll learn how to use webpack-dev-server which both bundles your code and its dependencies together and serves your web application in one seamless step

# Also by default webpack-dev-server now supports hot module replacement meaning anytime you make a file change it will automatically re-bundle your dependencies and refresh your state in browser

# You don't even need to refresh your browser!

# Add NPM dependencies
yarn

# Run webpack-dev-server to run webpack, bundle your code and dependencies, and serve your web application
yarn start

# Navigate to our app

# See our current message from App.vue

# Change our message in App.vue and save the changes

# If you see our new message in App.vue, then webpack watch is working!

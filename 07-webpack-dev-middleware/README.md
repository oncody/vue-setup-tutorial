# In this tutorial you'll learn how to use webpack-dev-middleware package

# Like webpack-dev-server, it bundles your code and its dependencies together and serves your web application in one seamless step

# This allows you to use node as your backend server and use webpack-dev-server to host and debug your frontend javascript code

# Add NPM dependencies
yarn

# Start the backend node express server which will integrate with webpack-dev-middleware to run webpack, bundle your code and dependencies, and serve your web application
yarn start

# Navigate to our app

# See our current message from App.vue

# Change our message in App.vue and save the changes

# If you see our new message in App.vue, then webpack watch is working!
